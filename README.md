# Time-Variant RSI Mathematical Framework

## Overview

This repository contains the mathematical formulation and documentation for a time-variant extension of the Relative Strength Index (RSI), enabling predictive analysis of security price movements across multiple time horizons. The model transforms the traditional RSI from a lagging technical indicator into a forward-looking analytical system.

## Key Features

- **Multi-period prediction**: Generates families of potential RSI and price curves from 1-day to 1-month horizons
- **Stochastic process modeling**: Implements mean-reverting processes with time-varying parameters
- **Regime-dependent behavior**: Adapts to trending, mean-reverting, and high-volatility market states
- **Temporal weighting**: Replaces fixed lookback periods with dynamic decay functions

## Documentation

The main LaTeX document (`whitepaper.tex`) provides a comprehensive mathematical formulation, including:

- Theoretical foundation and mathematical derivations
- Algorithm specifications for path generation
- Model calibration methodologies
- Implementation guidelines
- Applications in trading strategies
